• Created initial project setup,documented and helped team-members to kick start development.
• Documented the GIT usage, telemetry and their configs.
• Worked on multiple modules viz. connectinfy,careersite, op, recruiter and now in offer module which helped me to pick up things in short time.
• Solved critical issues like sonar errors, connectinfy VA/SAST issues, optimised search functionality. 
• Created working solution for formula injection while uploading excel file.
• I am known for quality work and bug free code, following proper indentation and annotations while developing .
• Created multiple reusable components
   ➼ multiple file attach
   ➼ snack bar with customised message,time and icon
   ➼ date to seconds conersio pipe
• Helped most of the team members whether it's critical issue or bug or development which is most of the times unrecognised task.
• I am enthusiastic and  showed interest on new things which sharpens my tech stack skills.



• I always adhere to most of commitments/deliverables, but some couldn't because cooperation from other team,
• I always try to put in my innovativeness / make it reusable whatever the task being given, but there were situations where it is time bound which impacted expected result.
• Sometimes I lack in proper collaboration among team, because I always felt individuality should be maintained, peeking in other work would create chaos.
• I think planning should be in more efficient way, there is a great saying by Abraham lincoln,  If I had eight hours to chop down a tree, I’d spend the first six of them sharpening my axe.
• I wish I could have contributed more if guided in architectural view and little bit recognition.
